How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It makes people easy to find difference between two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It contributes to help programmer to find any origin of error!!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Git would be better to make a commit to show the history of logical change. However, Google docs's commit could be meaningless because of automatic saved commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files are highly related to each others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    "git log" is to find ID of commits. "git diff" is to find the differences between two commits. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using git checkout, we can reset all of files to the previous version we want to back and chek the errors at that version. Also, we can recover it, too. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    CODING!!!
