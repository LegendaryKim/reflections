When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I do co-operate with my colleages.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic pull can cover my current updated files before pushing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks: for copying repositories within Github
    clones: for coping repositories between Github and local, within local
    branches: make branches of commit in local

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    maintain the original state from other's change

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Harder... Specially, when we collaborate on developing codes in one project... it would be harder to get feed-back.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    We can try to build several sub-version as maintaining the original.
